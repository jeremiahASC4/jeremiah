    <p>Brave Frontier bears all the battle scars of a traditional JRPG: a hidden power, magic, oversized swords, floppy hair. It’s all there.

This isn’t a PlayStation-era JRPG unceremoniously crammed onto a mobile, though. The game’s creator, A-Lim, decided to take a more considered approach and create a game that felt right for the device.

The finished product is unashamedly a mobile game, with combat a series of taps and the game itself free-to-play, but it still wears that spiky hair and troubled past with confidence.</p>
<p> The game’s executive producer, Hisatoshi Hayakashi, openly cites some of the genre’s classics as inspiration for Brave Frontier. Final Fantasy, Valkyrie Profile, Romancing SaGa, Star Ocean and the Tales Of  series all inspired design in some way.

We are focused on developing games that players can enjoy. It is more important than generating profit.HISATOSHI HAYAKASHI
Hayakashi considers these games as having an interesting perspective on the world, an interesting story and innovative combat mechanics.</p>
